# Azure Synapse

## Access Azure Synapse

1. Make sure you are in your cloud VM in order to access Azure Synapse. See [Virtual Machines](VirtualMachines.md) for information on how to create one if needed.

2. Inside your virtual machine, open a web browser and navigate to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com). Sign in with your cloud account credentials.

3. Start typing "synapse" into the search bar to find **Azure Synapse Analytics**.

2. Find your dedicated SQL pool in the list and hover over it. You should see a pause button if the pool is currently running, or a start button if it is not. Click the button to start or stop your SQL pool.

Note: SQL pools automatically stop running after one hour of inactivity.

## Home

The **Home** tab is where you start when you first open Azure Synapse Studio. 

From here, you can access shortcuts for common tasks such as creating SQL scripts or notebooks by clicking the **New** dropdown menu button. Recently opened resources are also displayed.
