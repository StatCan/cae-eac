2. Select the DevTest Lab that was assigned.
 
## Create Your Virtual Machine
**Note:** In some instances a Virtual Machine will be pre-created for you and you will not have permission to create a virtual machine. See the [FAQ](FAQ.md) if you need to make changes to your virtual machine.  

1. From the DevTest Lab **Overview** page, click on the **+ Add** button.  
2. Choose an appropriate base for your VM (e.g., Data Science Virtual Machine - Windows Server 2019). For more details on the software included with the Data Science Virtual Machines, please [click here]( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/tools-included ).  
3. Enter a name for your VM and a User name and password that you will use to login to the VM. Be sure to deselect the *Use a saved secret* and *Save as default password* checkboxes.
4. You may click the **Change Size Link** to change your VM size if you wish to do so.

Leave the rest as defaults and click on the **Create** button.

## Connect To Your Virtual Machine

2. Ensure the *Open in new window* checkbox is selected, enter the Username and Password that you used when you created your VM, and click on the **Connect** button. Your VM should open in a new browser tab.

    **Note** : By default, the **Ubuntu** virtual machine opens in Terminal mode. You can access the GUI of your Ubuntu machine from a Windows machine using [X2Go](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro#x2go).

    **Note** : After attempting to login for the first time, an error may appear that a popup blocker is preventing a new window to open. To disable it, an icon will pop up on the browser's search bar, select the button and click **always allow**.

## Stop Your Virtual Machine
Virtual machines only incur costs while they are running. You should shut down your virtual machine when not in use to prevent unneccessary charges.
1. From the **Overview** page for your VM, click on the **Stop** button.
