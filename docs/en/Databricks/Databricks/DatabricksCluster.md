## Creating a Cluster

Since you do not have permission to create a cluster, please send a [slack](https://cae-eac.slack.com) message if a cluster has not been created for you or if you require changes to your cluster.

**Note:** You must have a cluster running before you can run code inside your notebook. See below or the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for information on how to start a cluster.
