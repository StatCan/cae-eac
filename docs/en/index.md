## Data Analytics as a Service (DAS) offers the convenience and familiarity of statistical software
Data Analytics as a Service, powered by Statistics Canada, provides data stewards, analysts and researchers with access to public data and microdata in its Collaborative Analytics Environment. Using this secure, cloud-based data analytics service, holds many benefits.
- Upload and store data quickly and securely from an internal or external storage account.
- Choose from a variety of familiar tools to prepare and transform datasets.
- Analyze and present data using dynamic visualizations in order to share compelling data stories.

Please note that at this time, some statistical software tools may not be available for use in both official languages. Statistics Canada is working to ensure that all available data products and tools in the DAaaS platform will be accessible in both official languages in the near future. For more information, visit the [CAE language GitHub documentation](https://statcan.github.io/cae-eac/en/Language/).
