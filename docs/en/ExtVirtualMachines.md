   Each action will modify the Virtual Machine status.

2. **Start the virtual machine:** When the virtual machine status is stopped, the start button is highlighted. You can then start the virtual machine and its status will switch to *Starting*. The Start button is not highlighted anymore.
After that, it can take a few minute for the virtual machine to be in the *Running* mode. 
The browser connect button is then highlighted.
