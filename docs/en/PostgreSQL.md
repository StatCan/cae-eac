### Virtual Machine

You can access an Azure SQL database from your cloud virtual machine, using various applications including:
1. pgAdmin 
2. Azure Data Studio 
3. Visual Studio Code

#### Prerequisites
1.	A **virtual machine** in the Collaborative Analytics Environment (CAE). See the [VM page](VirtualMachines.md) for more information.
2.  **pgAdmin** or **Azure Data Studio** and **Visual Studio Code**. Those two are available by default in the **Windows Data Science Virtual Machine** images.  


# pgAdmin

6. The password you need to enter is a Azure AD access Token that will be generated for an authenticated Azure AD user. 
   From PowerShell, you can generate this access token by entering the following command

   *az account get-access-token --resource https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net*

   The output is as follow where you will need to copy the value for accessToken and use it as Password in  pgAdmin
