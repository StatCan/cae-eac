# Azure SQL Database
An Azure SQL Database can be setup in advance if your project requires one.

**Reminder**: The CAE Azure SQL Databases are only accessible from inside the CAE cloud environment. They are not accessible from any of the Government of Canada Data Centres.

## Accessing Azure SQL Database

### Azure Data Factory
A linked service can be setup inside Azure Data Factory. Configure the linked service to connect via the self-hosted integration runtime and use **Managed Identity** as the **Authentication type**. Please contact the support team through the https://cae-eac.slack.com channel if you need assistance.

### Databricks
Databricks notebooks can be configured to connect to the database. Because additional setup is required, please contact the the support team through the https://cae-eac.slack.com channel to request this configuration as well as example notebooks.

### Virtual Machine

You can access an Azure SQL database from your cloud virtual machine, using various applications including:  
1. SQL Server Management Studio 
2. Power BI Desktop
3. Azure Data Studio
4. Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

#### Prerequisites
