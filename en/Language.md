### Power BI Desktop

By default:

•   The **Application language** is based on the **Windows language**

•	The **Model language** is based on the **Application language**

•	The **Query steps** are based on the **Application language**

Setting the **Model language** to **English (United States)** is recommended.

The model language only applies **when the report is first created**, and **cannot be changed** on existing reports. Thus, setting the language model to **US English** is recommended, unless you have a specific need to use another language for the report model. String comparisons and internal date fields are affected by this setting.

To switch the Menu Language & Model Language in Power BI Desktop:

1.	Open the **Options** menu.

![Power BI D](images/LanguageSettings/PowerBiDesktop_En.jpg)   

2.	Under **GLOBAL**, click on **Regional Settings**, and set the **Application language** and **Model language** to the desired language.

 ![Power BI D02](images/LanguageSettings/PowerBiDesktop02_En.jpg)   

**NOTE**: The **Import language** is set separately in the **CURRENT FILE** section **Regional Settings**. You only need to change this if you import data files that have numbers and dates in a specific locale (e.g., English Canada DD/MM/YYYY, English US MM/DD/YYYY).
